*  ### Summary
Becoming a developer has been my dream for some time now. I have many developer friends that were always saying that I'd bee good at it, so I've decided to give it a shot and as it turns out, they were right.
I've started my programming adventure with Python, but I was always driven towards GUIs, buttons and colors, so I've tried a little of front-end development. I like it very much, but it's missing the "head-scratcher" part, where I can find a solution to more complex problems. That's where back-end development comes in. My ideal scenario is being a full-stack developer where I could combine my Python with my front-end skills.

    Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp
    Front-end advanced
    Web developer in 15 days
    Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming

*  ### English
My English skills are on a satisfactory level. For the last 2 years I've been working for an international company where written and spoken English is essential. 
In high school I participated in many English competitions with great results.
Moreover I graduated Italian Philology with Portuguese as my second language, so language studies are not alien to me.
